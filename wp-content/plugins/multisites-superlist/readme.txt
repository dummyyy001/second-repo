Replace that useless WordPress Multisite My Sites list with something far better!

== Description ==

If you manage lots of sites in a Multisite network, you'll know how frustrating using the Sites List can be. You can't scroll, so if you have more than 30 sites, you are forced to go to the Sites screen. The flyout submenus can be bit hard to navigate, and there are options in there that are kinda pointless (comments???).
* That said, the Sites List has a lot of potential, and I wanted to improve upon it. The ideas I had were:
* It should have useful links without submenus.
* It should have a search feature like the very cool plugin [My Sites Search](https://github.com/trepmal/my-sites-search) by [Kailey Lampert](https://github.com/trepmal)
